## Summary of learning objectives for the week

Agile
* **SCAFFOLD** Define an 'Agile process' [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) *(reading)*, [Agile Manifesto Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) *(reading)*]
* **SCAFFOLD** Discriminate between 'Agile' and 'non-Agile' processes, such as 'Waterfall' [[Scrum Reference Card](http://scrumreferencecard.com/scrum-reference-card/) *(reading, visual)*]
* Explain why **Makers Academy** do Agile

BDD
* **SCAFFOLD** Define 'user story' [[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) *(reading)*, [Agile Modelling: User Stories Introduction](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm) *(reading)*]
* **SCAFFOLD** Define 'domain model' [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/11/a-brief-introduction-to-domain-modelling/) *(reading)*, [Scaled Agile Framework: Domain Modelling](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/domain-modeling/) *(reading)*]
* **SCAFFOLD** Define 'class structure' [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/11/whats-a-class-structure/)]
* Illustrate links between user stories, domain models, and class structures
* Build a class structure from a user story, translating through a domain model
* Decide whether 'Agile' processes require a domain model first, or if a domain model can emerge for retrospective use

* **SCAFFOLD** Remember what Enough Design Up Front (EDUF), Big Design Up Front (BDUF), and No Design Up Front (NDUF) mean in the context of software design [[Samm's brief introduction](http://blog.sjmog.co/2015/03/12/software-design-up-front-how-much/)]
* Explain the motives behind EDUF, BDUF, and NDUF
* Justify why EDUF is more valuable in an Agile context than BDUF or NDUF

* Can differentiate between 'unit', 'integration' and 'feature' tests
* Construct a feature/integration test

TDD
* **SCAFFOLD** Remember that 'TDD' refers to 'Test-Driven Development'
* **SCAFFOLD** Explain what TDD is
* Identify why we do TDD at Makers Academy
* Defend TDD against alternative development methods

* **SCAFFOLD** Define RSpec as a testing framework that encourages TDD
* State RSpec 'best practices' using `describe`, `context`, and `it`
* Illustrate links between TDD and RSpec
* Initialize a new project for TDD with RSpec
* Implement RSpec best practices
* Infer why we always do the simplest thing first

Clean Code
* **SCAFFOLD** Know how to access style guidelines
* Use style guidelines in practices
* **EXTENSION** Compare different style guidelines
* **EXTENSION** Criticize a non-Makers styleguide

Doubles
* **SCAFFOLD** Recall what a double is
* **SCAFFOLD** Explain what a double does
* Outline why doubles are used
* Use doubles to test message expectations
* Use doubles to stub unpredictable behaviour

* Compare and contrast 'London' and 'Chicago' styles

Pair Programming
* **SCAFFOLD** define 'pair programming'
* Explain how pair programming works
* Argue why pair programming is often better than solo programming
* Use git and GitHub to share code with pair partner
* Evaluate how pair programming with a new partner every day has developed their proficiency in other topics, and more generally



### Activities
* Use BDD/TDD and pair programming together to create a simple model of the Boris Bikes problem in Ruby.
* Use BDD/TDD and solo programming to approach a slightly more complex model (e.g. Airports) which requires wider use of doubles.


Weekly Challenge
===========

## Airport

**Learning Objectives**

* Simple OOD and OOP creating and linking at least two objects via composition
* Mocking random behaviour effectively in order to ensure consistent and reliable tests
* Test driven development (TDD)


## Tube

**Learning Objectives**

* Simple OOD and OOP creating and linking at least two objects via composition
* Writing effective tests, i.e. doing TDD
