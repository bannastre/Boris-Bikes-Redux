# Removing 'magic numbers'

[Back to the Challenge Map](0_challenge_map.md)

Our code is starting to look pretty. It's legible - we could pass it to another developer with little or no explanation needed - and it's following the Single Responsibility Principle pretty well. However, we're making references to the number `20` repeatedly, without explaining what it is.

Since the number `20` is fixed in stone for now, we can use a **constant** to refactor this 'magic number' out of our code.

In this challenge, you will further refactor your code, using a **constant**.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Use a constant

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Define a constant, `DEFAULT_CAPACITY`, that stores the number `20`. Do this within the `DockingStation` class.
- [ ] Remove references to the magic number `20` in your implementation, using `DEFAULT_CAPACITY` instead.
- [ ] Refactor your tests to use this new constant instead of the magic number `20`.
