# Walkthrough - Removing Magic Numbers

[Back to the Challenge](../16_removing_magic_numbers.md)

We really should also deal with the 'magic number' `20`.  Magic numbers are a common source of bugs in computer programs.  They occur wherever a numeric literal (e.g `20`) is used in code and is related to a domain concept; in this case, the default capacity of a docking station.  In a large and complex program, if we were to see the literal `20` all over the place, it would not be obvious, without reading the context in which it is used, whether it is a reference to capacity or some other domain concept that happens to also be 20.  What if the default capacity changes?

To deal with this, we *encapsulate* the literal in a *constant* then use this constant everywhere else:

```ruby
class DockingStation
  DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 20

  # other code omitted for brevity

  def full?
    bikes.count >= DEFAULT_CAPACITY
  end
end
```

This is a good start, however is there anywhere else where we use the magic number `20`?  How about in our tests?  Here's a handy blog post on the subject of [testing with magic numbers](http://blog.silvabox.com/testing-with-magic-numbers/).

Remember this line in our tests?

```ruby
# in docking_station_spec.rb
20.times { subject.dock Bike.new }
```

Let's refactor it like so:

```ruby
DockingStation::DEFAULT_CAPACITY.times do
  subject.dock Bike.new
end
```

You can see we use `::` as a **Namespace operator**: we use it to access the `DEFAULT_CAPACITY` constant defined within the `DockingStation` class.

> What happens if we define `DEFAULT_CAPACITY` outside of the `DockingStation` class? Any reason that might be a bad idea?
